## Challenge for Module 1

In this challenge I changed many of the structure elements of the HTML. I changed the html to include main, nav, aside, header, footer, sections, and articles. 
Alongside with that I changed the css to reflect the new identifiers used and recreated the website to reflect the original view the client requested. 
I also added alt tags to all of the pictures that were available on the page to help promote searchability.
